== Description
   Interface to MS Windows Event objects.

== Prerequsites
   Requires the win32-ipc package.
   
== Installation
   rake test (optional)
   rake install

== Synopsis
   Win32::Event.new("Foo") do |event|
      event.set
      # Do stuff
      event.reset
   end

   e2 = Win32::Event.open("Bar")
   # Do stuff
   e2.close

== Documentation
   The event.rb file contains inline RDoc documentation. If you installed
   this file as a gem, then you have the docs.

== Notes
   The Event class is a subclass of Win32::Ipc (win32-ipc). This package
   require's the win32-ipc package internally (you don't need to explicitly
   call it).

   A PulseEvent() wrapper is intentionally omitted.  From the MSDN web site:
   "This function is unreliable and should not be used. It exists mainly for
   backward compatibility."

== Acknowledgements
   The Win32::Event Perl module by Chris Madsen was used as a general
   guideline for developing the API.
    
== Known Bugs
   None that I'm aware of. Please submit any bug reports to the project page
   at http://www.rubyforge.org/projects/win32utils.
